# Policy Compression Strategy

Insurance policies are often lengthy and complex. This project compresses policy data by:

- Extracting coverage limits
- Summarizing exclusions
- Identifying approval patterns from past claims

This compressed representation allows AI models to respond accurately with fewer tokens, improving efficiency and lowering operational cost.

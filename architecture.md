# System Architecture

The Insurance Claims Chatbot follows a simple modular architecture:

User → Chatbot Interface → Policy Compression Module → Claim Evaluation Engine → Response Generator

## Components
- User Interface: Command-line based interaction
- Policy Compression Module: Extracts essential rules from insurance policies
- Claim Evaluation Engine: Validates claims using compressed data
- Response Generator: Provides eligibility status and probability score

This architecture ensures fast response time and reduced AI processing cost.
